# Contribution Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in contributing to A9N project!
Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration process.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**: Create your own fork of the project repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a feature branch**: Use meaningful branch names based on the feature or bug you are addressing
(e.g., `feature/new-component`, `bugfix/memory-leak`).
3. **Write descriptive commit messages**: Clearly explain the changes you made in the commit message.
4. **Open a pull request (PR)**: Once your changes are ready, open a pull request. Include a description of what the PR does and why it's necessary.

## Code Standards

- **Follow the [Coding Guidelines](./CODING_GUIDELINES.md)**:
Adhere to the coding standards outlined in the Coding Guidelines document.
- **Ensure code is tested**: All new functionality must include corresponding unit tests. Use the testing structure already present in the project.
- **Document your code**: Provide documentation for any new public classes, functions, or modules.
- **Use appropriate tools**: Ensure that your code passes the build, formatting, and linting checks. The project uses tools like `.clang-format`.

## Pull Request Requirements

- **Keep changes focused**: A pull request should aim to solve a single issue or add a single feature. Avoid bundling unrelated changes.
- **Write a clear PR description**:
Clearly explain what the PR addresses, any trade-offs, and why the change is needed.
- **Include references**:
If your pull request fixes an issue, reference the issue number in the description (e.g., `Fixes #42`).
- **Address feedback**: Be open to feedback from maintainers. Respond promptly and update your pull request based on comments.

## Code Review Process

- All pull requests are subject to a **code review** by maintainers before merging.
- Code reviews help maintain code quality and improve collaboration. Constructive feedback is encouraged, and reviewers are expected to explain their reasoning.
